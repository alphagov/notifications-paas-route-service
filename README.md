# Reliability Engineering IP Whitelisting Route Service

This application contains a simple Nginx application which acts as a proxy for your web applications and provides an IP restriction layer

All PaaS traffic will go through the route service therefore we can completely protect and/or filter traffic with this service.

## Requirements

* Cloud Foundry CLI (https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)
* The manifest template is generated using Ruby ERB therefore Ruby needs to be installed.

You should log in using the Cloud Foundry CLI (https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/#setting-up-the-command-line).

For all actions you should always have to make sure you selected the space you intend to target.

## Deployment

The default application name is "re-whitelist-route-service". If you want to change this (or you want to deploy multiple route services), set the PAAS_APP_NAME environment variable for the make commands.

The default domain name is "cloudapps.digital". If you want to change this (or you want to bind to different domains), set the PAAS_DOMAIN environment variable for the make commands.

The secret values are read from an environment.sh file, so you have to set the environment variables on your local environment.

The instance count can be set with the PAAS_INSTANCES environment variable (1 by default).

## Deploying the route service application

If you're deploying the very first time, simply run:

```
make <PaaS space> paas-push
```

## Registering the application as a user-provided service

You only need to do this once per PaaS space.

```
make <PaaS space> paas-create-route-service
```

## Register the application as a route-service for a route

You only need to do this once per PaaS space and for all routes.

make <PaaS space> paas-bind-route-service PAAS_ROUTE=<route of your application>

## Complete installation example

In this example we are deploying the route service to preview and binding two applications to it, which are accessible on app-01.cloudapps.digital and app-02.cloudapps.digital.

```
# First installation:
make preview paas-push
make preview paas-create-route-service

# Run this for every applicaton once
make preview paas-bind-route-service PAAS_ROUTE=app-01
make preview paas-bind-route-service PAAS_ROUTE=app-02
